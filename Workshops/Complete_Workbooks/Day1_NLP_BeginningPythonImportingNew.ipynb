    "- Objects vs attributes vs methods\n",
    "    - **Objects** are instances of something called a **class**. All objects of the same class have similar properties, but different specific values. For example, think about a car. The class Car might have some rules: 4 wheels, metal body, steering wheel. Specific instances of Cars, Car objects, could be very different (a gray Toyota, a blue SmartCar, a red Ferrari) but all of them follow the rules of the Car class. \n",
    "    - ** Attributes ** are some of what make these cars different! For example, the class Car might have an attribute color. Ferrari.color would be red, while Toyota.color would be gray. You can set or get the value of an attribute by using the syntax variable.attribute \n",
    "    - ** Methods ** are very similar to ** functions **, which you already learned about. Like a function, a method is a command to perform a sequence of actions that can accept ** arguments ** inside of the parenthesis that follow it. The only difference between the two:\n",
    "        - A **method** is a function performed on or by an object. For example, ferrari.drive() might be a method that makes a specific car drive. \n",
    "        - A **function** stands on its own. print(\"Hello, World!\") doesn't act on an object, it just does something. \n",
    "    \n",
    "These distinctions can be confusing (even for computer scientists!), so don't be afraid to ask. "

Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. \\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a \"relatively small\" meteorite that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. \\r\\nMurillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was \"very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,\" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base.

Two Australians say they bought a few McDonald's burgers for friends back in 1995, when they were teens, and one of the friends never showed up. So the kid's burger went uneaten—and stayed that way, Australia's News Network reports. \"We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,\" says one of the men, Casey Dean. Holding onto the burger for their friend \"started off as a joke,\" he adds, but \"the months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDean and his burger-buying mate, Eduard Nitz, even took the burger on Australian TV show The Project last night and \"showed off the mold-free specimen,\" News 9 reports. The pair offered to take a bite of it for charity but were dissuaded by the show's hosts. They've also started a Facebook page for the burger called \"Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?\" that has more than 4,044 likes as of this writing. And they're selling an iTunes song, \"Free the Burger,\" for $1.69, and giving proceeds to the charity Beyond Blue, which helps Australians battle anxiety and depression. (A few years ago, a man sold a 20-year-old bottle of McDonald's McJordan sauce for $10,000. Here's why Mickey D's food seemingly never decays.)</td>\n",

British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.\\r\\nIn the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag “shibal_alBaghdadi” — which translates as “the cub of Baghdadi” — on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliph.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbu Ubaidah, the youngest fighter in the Islamic State got martyred with his father by US airstrikes 2 weeks ago. #IS http://t.co/N1PUeXI7iR\\r\\n\\r\\n— \\r\\nIslamic State Times (@ISTimes1) October 07, 2014\\r\\nMr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem “more brutal than it is,” the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seems like a very legitimate thing,” Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. “I would vouch for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.\\r\\nChildren are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in “uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,” the UN reported.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,” said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, we’re going to see this face to face,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground.</td>\n",

The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nA member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, “Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSeparately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.\\r\\n\\r\\nTada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,” he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain.

       "0  A small meteorite crashed into a wooded area in Nicaragua's capital of Managua overnight, the government said Sunday. Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. \\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a \"relatively small\" meteorite that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. \\r\\nMurillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was \"very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,\" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "2  (NEWSER) – Wonder how long a Quarter Pounder with cheese can last? Two Australians say they bought a few McDonald's burgers for friends back in 1995, when they were teens, and one of the friends never showed up. So the kid's burger went uneaten—and stayed that way, Australia's News Network reports. \"We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,\" says one of the men, Casey Dean. Holding onto the burger for their friend \"started off as a joke,\" he adds, but \"the months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDean and his burger-buying mate, Eduard Nitz, even took the burger on Australian TV show The Project last night and \"showed off the mold-free specimen,\" News 9 reports. The pair offered to take a bite of it for charity but were dissuaded by the show's hosts. They've also started a Facebook page for the burger called \"Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?\" that has more than 4,044 likes as of this writing. And they're selling an iTunes song, \"Free the Burger,\" for $1.69, and giving proceeds to the charity Beyond Blue, which helps Australians battle anxiety and depression.

       "3  Posting photos of a gun-toting child online, ISIS supporters announced that the group’s youngest soldier has died in combat.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwitter accounts linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham claimed that the child soldier “got martyred” with his father while fighting for the terrorist group in Syria.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhotos posted on Twitter showed the smiling boy in military fatigues holding weapons that, at times, are almost as large as his body. British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.\\r\\nIn the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag “shibal_alBaghdadi” — which translates as “the cub of Baghdadi” — on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliph.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbu Ubaidah, the youngest fighter in the Islamic State got martyred with his father by US airstrikes 2 weeks ago. #IS http://t.co/N1PUeXI7iR\\r\\n\\r\\n— \\r\\nIslamic State Times (@ISTimes1) October 07, 2014\\r\\nMr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem “more brutal than it is,” the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seems like a very legitimate thing,” Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. “I would vouch for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.\\r\\nChildren are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in “uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,” the UN reported.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,” said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, we’re going to see this face to face,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground.  \n",
       "4  At least 25 suspected Boko Haram insurgents were killed in clashes between soldiers and the Islamist militants in northeast Nigeria and five civilians were killed in fighting elsewhere in the region, a military source and residents said on Monday.\\r\\n\\r\\nA ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the militants six months ago, and talks were due to continue in neighbouring Chad on Monday.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least six attacks over the weekend – blamed by security sources on the insurgents – that have killed several dozen people since the announcement of the ceasefire.\\r\\n\\r\\nA government spokesman has said that the fighting on Sunday may be the work of criminal gangs in the lawless region.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn army officer, who requested anonymity, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but soldiers fought them off. “Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,” the officer said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said an armoured vehicle and some arms were recovered from the insurgents.\\r\\n\\r\\nDamboa, a garrison town near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nA member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, “Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSeparately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.\\r\\n\\r\\nTada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,” he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain. When the insurgents sighted our people, they pursued them and slaughtered five,” Tada said.

       "      <td>A small meteorite crashed into a wooded area in Nicaragua's capital of Managua overnight, the government said Sunday. Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. \\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a \"relatively small\" meteorite that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. \\r\\nMurillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was \"very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,\" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base.

       "      <td>There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that we’ve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights. Fake DHL ads. Amazing viral video? Nope — a Jimmy Kimmel stunt!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, we’re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldn’t share over the weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nReady? Here’s what was fake on the Internet this week:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The Nobel Committee doesn’t “regret” giving President Obama the Peace Prize. According to an invented “news release” uploaded to Scribd by the prominent blogger and anti-war activist David Swanson, the Nobel Institute can’t retract Obama’s 2009 Peace Prize — but wishes it could. “It remains the obligation of the Committee to disassociate itself from actions taken by laureates that frustrate rather than advancing [sic] the fraternity between nations,” the statement reads. (Pro-tip: International organizations rarely make glaring grammatical errors in major statements.) “The Committee therefore joins with the public statements of several Nobel Peace Laureates in expressing its regrets over the conduct of the 2009 prize recipient.” The announcement has since been picked up by a number of right-wing outlets, including Before It’s News. The only problem, of course: It isn’t true.\\r\\n\\r\\nDear Internet: The Nobel committee ″regrets” giving Obama the 2009 peace prize story is bogus. I just spoke with the head of the institute\\r\\n\\r\\n2. There is no-such thing as a “pumpkin-spice-flavored condom.” Though considering the social media response to the idea, some enterprising company may want to give it a try. A Photoshopped image of the “limited edition” Durex condom circulated widely on Twitter and Facebook last week before a punny statement from Durex punctured the hoax: “We can’t claim this one,” the company said, “but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.” Har har. In unrelated pumpkin-spice news, the limited-edition Oreos of the flavor are apparently quite real.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve officially reached Pumpkin Spice saturation point. pic.twitter.com/Tve77ov5JZ\\r\\n\\r\\n3. No one expects “record-shattering snowfall” this year. That claim — like so many others! — comes from the unfunny “satirists” at EmpireNews.net, increasingly our least favorite fake-news site in a generally unfavorable field. According to the story and its accompanying map, meteorologists have expected “above normal snowfall” in huge swaths of the United States, including the entire mid-Atlantic coast. Like everything else on Empire News, of course, the map is fake. Moreover, it’s so difficult to predict seasonal weather patterns that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration doesn’t bust theirs out until November, and the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., told the Baltimore Sun they have virtually no idea what the snow will look like three long months from now.\\r\\n\\r\\n#InOtherNews I just read a report that a meteorologist said we will be having ″record shattering snowfall” this winter. Lord Jesus.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. “Male birth control” will probably not be here by 2017. A number of outlets gleefully proclaimed the news that a “male birth control” injection, called Vasalgel, would be hitting the world’s bedrooms within three years. Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that it’s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration — and neither of those things are true. “The news came from a press release — and call for donations! — by the foundation behind Vasalgel,” Julia Belluz explained at Vox, “highlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.” Bottom line: It’s great that someone’s working on male birth control, but it’s highly unlikely this particular product will reach the U.S. market by 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. There was not a shooting at a California Marine Corps base. An anonymous Facebook page sparked all-out panic at a base north of San Diego on Thursday night when it posted that a shooter was active at the military installation and that “ALL MARINES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOCK THEMSELVES INSIDE OF THEIR ROOMS.” The page then stupidly followed that prank post up with a number of “updates” on the situation, which were liked and shared hundreds of times. Base police told Business Insider there was no evidence at all of a shooting: People “saw if on social media networks and then they started telling their friends,” one dispatcher said. “It’s all rumor, it’s all hearsay.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPossible shooter in Camp Pendleton!? Anybody hear anything??\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Shakira is not dead. The singer’s hips don’t lie, but the Internet does. Constantly. A hoax e-mail bearing the logo of Mexican newspaper El Universal claimed that Shakira died in a car accident in Colombia last week, and that an attached Word document contained “exclusive images and details” from the scene. Colombia’s Informador reports that the e-mail may actually have contained a virus or phishing scam. As for Shakira, she’s alive and well and expecting her second child with boyfriend Gerard Pique.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. British Muslims are not trying to outlaw a beloved children’s TV show. A comedian going by the name Zayn Sheikh outraged many Brits (and fooled a number of news outlets, British and otherwise) with a YouTube video that demanded the TV show “Peppa Pig” go off air and suggested a national campaign would soon organize for that purpose. Peppa Pig is a beloved, alliterative British cartoon character — and also “haram,” or forbidden to Muslims, Sheikh claimed. Over the weekend, Sheikh posted a second video admitting the whole thing was a hoax — but a hoax for a cause. “This video served to show how much Islamophobia is around, for those who deny its existence,” he wrote. “It is sad to live in a society where some feel that Muslims have no rights to talk at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Obama will not “resign amid new Benghazi revelations.” Every word of this headline is a dream come true to some of the president’s more conspiracy-minded opponents, which perhaps explains why the fake article, from fake-article-generator National Report, went viral in those circles. As of this writing, it’s been shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. Even Donald Trump seems to have fallen for the “joke”!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Just kidding, that tweet is related to another matter entirely.)\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Cocaine has not been found in Coors Light beer. Since this is the second widespread cocaine-in-a-beverage hoax in as many weeks, let’s get a few things straight about the alleged phenomenon. First up: This hoax seems to do well because it has some remote, and long ago, bases in fact. (Cocaine-laced sodas and beverages were very popular in ye olden days, around the time of the Civil War.) It also helps that remote traces of coca have been found, at some point in time, in various popular beverages, including Red Bull. That said, no cocaine expose published on a site called Huzlers.com is ever going to be real. Ever. How have 286,000 people shared this stupid thing?\\r\\n\\r\\n10. The ruins of an ancient city were not discovered in the Australian desert. Perhaps the most incredible thing about this faux-story from World News Daily Report — besides the number of times people have reposted it to Facebook — is the amazingly credulous conversation readers are having in the comments section below it. “I thought the climate in central Australia had been arid for over 30,000 years,” one commenter wrote. “30,000 people living in the desert? That would require agriculture and irrigation … That’s just incredible!” Indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid we miss any other notable fake stuff this week?

       "      <td>Phoenix, AZ — A Phoenix boy is behind bars tonight after his mother called 9-1-1 when she found her son in his room, watching pornography and masturbating. Phoenix Police were quick to respond, arresting 15-year-old Paul Horner, who attends North Valley High School in Phoenix, Arizona. Now the teenager is being held without bail and charged by prosecutors under a new controversial Arizona state law called ‘Self-Rape’, which carries a minimum of 3 years in prison with a maximum of 15 years behind bars depending on that individuals past criminal history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the first time this new state law has been used since it was put into action last month by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. Brewer spoke with local news station ABC 15 about the charges against the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I applaud the Arizona District court systems here in Phoenix,” Brewer said. “This is exactly why I implemented the state law of ‘Self-Rape’ last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. Before my time as governor is up early next year, I’ll do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don’t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it’s too late.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHorner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the United States District Court in Phoenix, which included the brand new ‘Self-Rape’ state law, Horner immediately broke down into tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nTranscripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:\\r\\n\\r\\n“911, what’s your emergency?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Help! My son is watching porn and masturbating! That is not allowed in his house and I don’t know what kind of demons possessed him to degrade his body in such a matter. I’m so shakin’ up! Please send help immediately!”\\r\\n\\r\\n32-year-old Adeline Horner, Horner’s mother, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Up until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,” Horner’s mother said. “But somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil’s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWinters controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.\\r\\n\\r\\n“STOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Adeline Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,” Childs told reporters. “She really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Ant-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 36-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fappy® has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things. Our organization is passionate about the great work that we do. The children even have a nickname for Fappy®, they call him the tickle monster. Working side by side with such great women as Jan Brewer, we’re ridding the demons from these heathens pants, one pair of pants at a time. Fappy® vows to stay on this case until justice is served!”\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Downey with the Phoenix Police Department, who took the child into custody, spoke with Arizona news station Fox 10 News about the arrest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We thought at first he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about how we should leave him alone and just let him watch his filth, makes me sick! It’s a slippery slope my friend, one day it’s masturbating to porn, the next day it’s raping some innocent school girl.

According to reports, after hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed. A video was even produced purporting to reveal Banksy’s real identity:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to reports:\\r\\n\\r\\n“…The City of London Police say Banksy’s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run. “We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky’s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,” Edwards said.”\\r\\n\\r\\n banksy-mugshot\\r\\n(ABOVE: A mugshot CLAIMING to have been taken by London Police today of Paul Horner AKA Banksy.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n“We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.” Edwards continued, “Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.”\\r\\n\\r\\npaul-horner-is-banksy\\r\\n(ABOVE: According to reports, this is a photo of Banksy, AKA Paul Horner, seen here being taken into police custody.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the “if it’s on the internet, it must be true” adage, we immediately smelled HOAX, so did a bit of digging (our mascot Fido is good at that).  It didn’t take long (30 seconds in fact), to rule this out as a not-very-elaborate fake.  We reached out to Banksy’s PR agent Jo Brooks, who confirmed the hoax in 3 simple words:\\r\\n\\r\\nBanksy’s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we can all breath a big sigh of relief… inhale, exhale… Banksy is still a mystery.

       "      <td>FEARS have been raised that Islamic militants have seized a dozen commercial aircraft in an attack on a Libyan airport last week. Now, according to a report, intelligence agencies are warning the jets could be used in 9/11-style attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” one official told The Washington Free Beacon this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report said intelligence reports distributed within the US government over the past few weeks have detailed the types of aircraft believed seized. Several have the size and range to reach deep into Europe and Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beacon reports the analysts as issuing a specific warning — that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack on the date marking the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe threat warning comes as dramatic video reveals the final moments of a Libyan combat jet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aircraft plunged into the ground less than a kilometre from the country’s parliament during a fly-past intended to honour the pilot of another fighter jet that died in a crash a week ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resulting fireball damaged several nearby buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\nLibya is witnessing its worst violence since former dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi was toppled and killed in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country’s divisions are deeply rooted in rivalries between Islamists and non-Islamists, as well as powerful tribal and regional allegiances between groups that quickly filled the power vacuum after Gaddafi’s was ousted. Successive transitional governments have failed to control the militias.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIGHTING FLARES UP\\r\\n\\r\\nFierce clashes have erupted in recent days over Libya’s eastern city of Benghazi.\\r\\n\\r\\nFighting between Islamist militiamen and rival forces loyal to a renegade general killed 31 fighters on both sides, a security official said overnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting erupted late on Monday, with forces and fighter jets belonging to General Khalifa Hifter pounding positions of Islamist militias called The Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council, said the official.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue of foreign military intervention is one of the most debated in the country. Earlier this month, unknown parties carried out air strikes in Tripoli, bombing Islamist-allied militias’ positions. American officials confirmed reports that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were behind the two air strikes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hours-long clashes concentrated around the city’s Benina airport and the militiamen responded with artillery, added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media.\\r\\n\\r\\nHifter’s side lost 20 fighters while the militiamen had 11 killed, and 36 fighters in all were wounded, the official said. Several of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nFighting in recent months has mostly engulfed the capital, Tripoli, and also Benghazi, the country’s second-largest city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe militias in control of the capital, operating under an umbrella group called the Dawn of Libya, have also taken control of the US embassy compound a week after they drove out rival militias.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday, Libya’s official news agency said calm had returned to Tripoli, with some banks resuming work and shops and bakeries reopening. Traffic also picked up in the capital and there were long lines outside gas stations. Some families who fled the fighting areas have returned to their homes, the agency said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPOLITICAL CRISIS\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Monday, Libya’s newly elected parliament asked Abdullah al-Thinni — the country’s prime minister who resigned last week — to form a new government. Al-Thinni had said after his resignation that his government had lost control of almost all state institutions and government offices to the armed Islamist militias.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting forced the newly elected parliament and al-Thinni to operate in the eastern city of Tobruk.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday, Mohammed Shouaib, the deputy head of parliament, stressed that the body did not ask for “military intervention” but for the United Nations to help Libya build its institutions, including the police and military. He was referring to an earlier decision by the parliament to call for international help in restoring order in Libya.\\r\\n\\r\\nShouaib was speaking in a press conference with British envoy Jonathan Powell and British ambassador Michael Aron, who were visiting Tobruk to express support to the elected parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile in Tripoli, a parallel government is in the making. Supported by Islamist allies, the so-called National Salvation government led by Omar al-Hassi and his 14-ministers won a vote of confidence. Al-Hassi was appointed by the outgoing parliament — whose mandate expired after a new parliament was elected — and assigned him to form a new government to challenge the legitimate ones in Tobruk.</td>\n",

It was veritable catnip to social media.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it turned out the pope had not made the comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nlRelated Pope Francis prays in Istanbul's Blue Mosque\\r\\nNATION &amp; WORLD\\r\\nPope Francis prays in Istanbul's Blue Mosque\\r\\nSEE ALL RELATED\\t\\r\\n8\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov. 26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nPope Paul VI, who died in 1978, once said, reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died, \"one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done,\" the Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini, said on Saturday, when asked about how the media ran with the story.\\r\\n\\r\\ncComments\\r\\n@franniescarp In contrast to yours...\\r\\nJ. PAUL GETTY'S EAR\\r\\nAT 7:10 PM DECEMBER 13, 2014\\r\\nADD A COMMENTSEE ALL COMMENTS\\t\\r\\n6\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion News Service was among the first media to set the record straight. It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov. 27, whose headline was misleading.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe article recounted the pope's words from his general audience on Nov. 26, when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth. It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI, but its headline said \"The pope and animals. 'paradise is open to all creatures.'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York Times, which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis, acknowledged its mistake, saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked about the mistake, a spokeswoman for the Times quoted Michael Slackman, managing editor of international news, as saying, \"The correction in The Times notes that the specific content and wording were wrong in the article. However, the pope did in fact make comments suggesting heaven is open to animals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his Nov. 26 remarks, the pope referred to heaven saying \"the Sacred Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this marvelous plan cannot but affect all that which surrounds us and which emerged from the thought and the heart of God.\" He did not refer specifically to animals in his remarks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn its website, CNN also corrected its story, noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven. A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nReuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT DOES THE POPE THINK ABOUT PETS?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for what Francis does think about animals, he has not spoken much about them in public, but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures \"it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year, Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it. The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs, Benedettini said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God. In 2008, former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were \"called to eternity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nReuters</td>\n",

       "      <td>After a full day spent lying on her back on a muddy wooden plank, chipping with painstaking care at the underside of a stone block to free the time capsule hidden within, Museum of Fine Arts conservator Pam Hatchfield sat up in front of the State House to a round of applause, a green box held delicately in her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I feel happy and relieved. And excited. And really interested to see what’s in this box,” she said Thursday night, after posing for a selfie with the capsule for her mom. The extrication took more than seven hours and involved about a dozen workers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original contents of the time capsule were first placed in 1795 by Governor Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and William Scollay in a ceremony that started in downtown Boston and proceeded to the State House, according to historical accounts. It was unearthed during emergency repairs to the foundation in 1855 and then buried again, and had not seen daylight until it emerged on Thursday.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building, but of our Commonwealth and our country,” said Secretary of State William Galvin, who was on hand for the capsule’s first appearance in more than 150 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe capsule is believed to include a collection of silver and copper coins dating from between 1652 and 1855; an engraved silver plate; newspapers; the seal of the Commonwealth; cards; and a title page from the Massachusetts Colony Records, according to Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter hours of work, Pam Hatchfield, a conservator at the Museum of Fine Arts, dislodged a time capsule from the cornerstone of the State House.\\r\\nARAM BOGHOSIAN FOR THE BOSTON GLOBE\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter hours of work, Pam Hatchfield, a conservator at the Museum of Fine Arts, dislodged a time capsule from the cornerstone of the State House.\\r\\n\\r\\n View Gallery\\r\\nPhotos: Capsule unearthed\\r\\nThe original contents of the time capsule were first placed in 1795 by Governor Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and William Scollay.\\r\\n Mass. time capsule contents include 350-year-old shilling\\r\\n\\r\\nHatchfield, who is head of Objects Conservation at the Museum of Fine Arts, said the corroded copper alloy box that holds the collection was undamaged by the removal process, and appeared to be in good shape. It was a little smaller than a cigar box and, she said, heavier than she expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe box was taken by State Police escort to the Museum of Fine Arts, where Hatchfield said it will be X-rayed to determine the contents. There was some concern, Galvin said, that there may be some damage to some of the coins, which may have been washed in acid before the box was reburied in 1855.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will be opened probably sometime next week,” said Galvin. The contents will be examined, he said, but the time capsule will not remain unburied. “Ultimately it will be put back in the box and ultimately back in the stone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGalvin said officials have not yet decided whether they will add any objects to the capsule before re-burying it. The capsule was discovered during the course of a water infiltration investigation at the State House, which identified the corner where it was hidden as an area of concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is believed to be one of the oldest time capsules in the state, according to Kelly. In October, a century-old time capsule was opened after it was removed from its perch in the head of a golden lion statue that had sat atop the Old State House in downtown Boston. Its contents included sealed letters, photographs, and newspaper articles in near-perfect condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Thursday, excavation of the State House time capsule began at about 9 a.m., with workers unwedging the stone block from the corner of the building and propping it up on blocks of wood so Hatchfield could slide underneath. The block was not flipped upside down, said Hatchfield, because she did not want to risk dislodging any of the contents.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom about 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Hatchfield tapped away at the block, taking periodic breaks to warm up away from the whipping wind and snow. Workers brought her a space heater. The plaster that sealed the box in, she said, was much harder than she anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she worked, tiny coins fell out of the plaster. During the 1855 reburial, public officials threw the coins in for good luck. Michael Comeau, executive director of the State Archives, said they appeared to be silver.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the day wore on, Hatchfield used a small circular saw and a drill to try to free the capsule, and several times, she appeared to think she was close, only to have the box remain stuck. It was the most physically challenging conservation job she has ever done, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have been privileged to spend all of my working life handling incredibly precious and important objects, and it is very exciting every single time,” said Hatchfield. “The sense of continuation of history that you get by entering a museum or historic site, but also by having it in your hands, is incredibly rewarding and enriching. And it gives meaning to a lot of people.”</td>\n",

Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U.S. heavy weapons, including portable surface-to-air missiles, as well as for American air support.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement issued after the president’s remarks, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, “We must get serious about confronting this force, including by aggressively arming those battling it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White House confirmed early Wednesday that U.S. intelligence had deemed the video authentic.

In the video, his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter beheading Foley, the executioner is pictured with a second captive, identified as U.S. freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff, who disappeared last year in Syria. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the executioner says.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview with the BBC, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine. Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it to the speech of former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPraising James Foley as “an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, according to a 2013 Global­Post article, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012. No one has claimed to be holding them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66 journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the group’s control.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes. “We will drown all of you in blood,” it said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nA masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,” the masked man says.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” he says. He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner also appeals to “my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force,” to “think about what you are doing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish I had more time,” he says. “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t an American.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe masked man then identifies the prisoner as “James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.” He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner; the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe masked man then appears with another prisoner, identified as Sotloff, in a similar kneeling position.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi. According to Global­Post, two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver-colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then, Global­Post “has mounted an extensive international investigation . . . to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held,” Global­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nJulie Tate and Dan Lamothe in Washington, Griff Witte in London and Souad Mekhennet in Frankfurt, Germany, contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>President Obama said Wednesday that the United States “will be vigilant and we will be relentless” against Islamic State militants and would “do what’s necessary to see that justice is done” following the videotaped execution of an American journalist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIL,” Obama said, using one of several acronyms for the group. The militants, who posted the video on YouTube Tuesday, said Foley’s killing was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama, who spoke Wednesday morning to Foley’s parents, offered no new policy measures to confront Islamic State. Referring to neighboring countries and U.S. allies, he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes, one U.S. official said the “only question is if we do more.” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama could face pressure to escalate the air campaign in Iraq and increase support to U.S.-backed rebels in Syria who are fighting against the Islamic Front, as well as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U.S. heavy weapons, including portable surface-to-air missiles, as well as for American air support.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement issued after the president’s remarks, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, “We must get serious about confronting this force, including by aggressively arming those battling it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White House confirmed early Wednesday that U.S. intelligence had deemed the video authentic. Obama spoke in Martha’s Vineyard, where he is vacationing with his family.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native and a photojournalist working for the Boston-based Web site Global­Post, was kidnapped in northern Syria nearly two years ago while covering the civil war in Syria.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Britain Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria, amid indications that a British citizen was involved in Foley’s killing. In the video, his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter beheading Foley, the executioner is pictured with a second captive, identified as U.S. freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff, who disappeared last year in Syria. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the executioner says.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview with the BBC, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine. Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it to the speech of former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foley’s mother wrote: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim,” Diane Foley wrote. “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPraising James Foley as “an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, according to a 2013 Global­Post article, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012. No one has claimed to be holding them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66 journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

       "      <td>President Obama said Wednesday that the United States “will be vigilant and we will be relentless” against Islamic State militants and would “do what’s necessary to see that justice is done” following the videotaped execution of an American journalist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIL,” Obama said, using one of several acronyms for the group. The militants, who posted the video on YouTube Tuesday, said Foley’s killing was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama, who spoke Wednesday morning to Foley’s parents, offered no new policy measures to confront Islamic State. Referring to neighboring countries and U.S. allies, he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes, one U.S. official said the “only question is if we do more.” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama could face pressure to escalate the air campaign in Iraq and increase support to U.S.-backed rebels in Syria who are fighting against the Islamic Front, as well as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U.S. heavy weapons, including portable surface-to-air missiles, as well as for American air support.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement issued after the president’s remarks, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, “We must get serious about confronting this force, including by aggressively arming those battling it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White House confirmed early Wednesday that U.S. intelligence had deemed the video authentic. Obama spoke in Martha’s Vineyard, where he is vacationing with his family.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native and a photojournalist working for the Boston-based Web site Global­Post, was kidnapped in northern Syria nearly two years ago while covering the civil war in Syria.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Britain Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria, amid indications that a British citizen was involved in Foley’s killing. In the video, his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter beheading Foley, the executioner is pictured with a second captive, identified as U.S. freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff, who disappeared last year in Syria. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the executioner says.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview with the BBC, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine. Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it to the speech of former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foley’s mother wrote: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim,” Diane Foley wrote. “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPraising James Foley as “an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, according to a 2013 Global­Post article, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012. No one has claimed to be holding them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66 journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the group’s control.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes. “We will drown all of you in blood,” it said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nA masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,” the masked man says.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” he says. He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner also appeals to “my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force,” to “think about what you are doing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish I had more time,” he says. “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed.

Referring to neighboring countries and U.S. allies, he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes, one U.S. official said the “only question is if we do more.” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama could face pressure to escalate the air campaign in Iraq and increase support to U.S.-backed rebels in Syria who are fighting against the Islamic Front, as well as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U.S. heavy weapons, including portable surface-to-air missiles, as well as for American air support.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement issued after the president’s remarks, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, “We must get serious about confronting this force, including by aggressively arming those battling it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White House confirmed early Wednesday that U.S. intelligence had deemed the video authentic. Obama spoke in Martha’s Vineyard, where he is vacationing with his family.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native and a photojournalist working for the Boston-based Web site Global­Post, was kidnapped in northern Syria nearly two years ago while covering the civil war in Syria.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Britain Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria, amid indications that a British citizen was involved in Foley’s killing. In the video, his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter beheading Foley, the executioner is pictured with a second captive, identified as U.S. freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff, who disappeared last year in Syria. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the executioner says.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview with the BBC, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine. Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it to the speech of former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foley’s mother wrote: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim,” Diane Foley wrote. “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPraising James Foley as “an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, according to a 2013 Global­Post article, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012. No one has claimed to be holding them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66 journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the group’s control.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes. “We will drown all of you in blood,” it said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nA masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,” the masked man says.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” he says. He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner also appeals to “my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force,” to “think about what you are doing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish I had more time,” he says. “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t an American.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe masked man then identifies the prisoner as “James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.” He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner; the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe masked man then appears with another prisoner, identified as Sotloff, in a similar kneeling position.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi. According to Global­Post, two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver-colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then, Global­Post “has mounted an extensive international investigation . . . to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held,” Global­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nJulie Tate and Dan Lamothe in Washington, Griff Witte in London and Souad Mekhennet in Frankfurt, Germany, contributed to this report.</td>\n",

Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEnough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRELATED: Since we’re talking about GNR, do yourself a favor and go back and read Danger Guerrero’s breakdown of “November Rain.”</td>\n",

       "24     A small meteorite crashed into a wooded area in Nicaragua's capital of Managua overnight, the government said Sunday. Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. \\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a \"relatively small\" meteorite that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. \\r\\nMurillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was \"very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,\" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it.

       "199    There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that we’ve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights. Fake DHL ads. Amazing viral video? Nope — a Jimmy Kimmel stunt!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, we’re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldn’t share over the weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nReady? Here’s what was fake on the Internet this week:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The Nobel Committee doesn’t “regret” giving President Obama the Peace Prize. According to an invented “news release” uploaded to Scribd by the prominent blogger and anti-war activist David Swanson, the Nobel Institute can’t retract Obama’s 2009 Peace Prize — but wishes it could. “It remains the obligation of the Committee to disassociate itself from actions taken by laureates that frustrate rather than advancing [sic] the fraternity between nations,” the statement reads. (Pro-tip: International organizations rarely make glaring grammatical errors in major statements.) “The Committee therefore joins with the public statements of several Nobel Peace Laureates in expressing its regrets over the conduct of the 2009 prize recipient.” The announcement has since been picked up by a number of right-wing outlets, including Before It’s News. The only problem, of course: It isn’t true.\\r\\n\\r\\nDear Internet: The Nobel committee ″regrets” giving Obama the 2009 peace prize story is bogus. I just spoke with the head of the institute\\r\\n\\r\\n2. There is no-such thing as a “pumpkin-spice-flavored condom.” Though considering the social media response to the idea, some enterprising company may want to give it a try. A Photoshopped image of the “limited edition” Durex condom circulated widely on Twitter and Facebook last week before a punny statement from Durex punctured the hoax: “We can’t claim this one,” the company said, “but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.” Har har. In unrelated pumpkin-spice news, the limited-edition Oreos of the flavor are apparently quite real.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve officially reached Pumpkin Spice saturation point. pic.twitter.com/Tve77ov5JZ\\r\\n\\r\\n3. No one expects “record-shattering snowfall” this year. That claim — like so many others! — comes from the unfunny “satirists” at EmpireNews.net, increasingly our least favorite fake-news site in a generally unfavorable field. According to the story and its accompanying map, meteorologists have expected “above normal snowfall” in huge swaths of the United States, including the entire mid-Atlantic coast. Like everything else on Empire News, of course, the map is fake. Moreover, it’s so difficult to predict seasonal weather patterns that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration doesn’t bust theirs out until November, and the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., told the Baltimore Sun they have virtually no idea what the snow will look like three long months from now.\\r\\n\\r\\n#InOtherNews I just read a report that a meteorologist said we will be having ″record shattering snowfall” this winter. Lord Jesus.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. “Male birth control” will probably not be here by 2017. A number of outlets gleefully proclaimed the news that a “male birth control” injection, called Vasalgel, would be hitting the world’s bedrooms within three years. Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that it’s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration — and neither of those things are true. “The news came from a press release — and call for donations! — by the foundation behind Vasalgel,” Julia Belluz explained at Vox, “highlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.” Bottom line: It’s great that someone’s working on male birth control, but it’s highly unlikely this particular product will reach the U.S. market by 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. There was not a shooting at a California Marine Corps base. An anonymous Facebook page sparked all-out panic at a base north of San Diego on Thursday night when it posted that a shooter was active at the military installation and that “ALL MARINES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOCK THEMSELVES INSIDE OF THEIR ROOMS.” The page then stupidly followed that prank post up with a number of “updates” on the situation, which were liked and shared hundreds of times. Base police told Business Insider there was no evidence at all of a shooting: People “saw if on social media networks and then they started telling their friends,” one dispatcher said. “It’s all rumor, it’s all hearsay.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPossible shooter in Camp Pendleton!? Anybody hear anything??\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Shakira is not dead. The singer’s hips don’t lie, but the Internet does. Constantly. A hoax e-mail bearing the logo of Mexican newspaper El Universal claimed that Shakira died in a car accident in Colombia last week, and that an attached Word document contained “exclusive images and details” from the scene. Colombia’s Informador reports that the e-mail may actually have contained a virus or phishing scam. As for Shakira, she’s alive and well and expecting her second child with boyfriend Gerard Pique.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. British Muslims are not trying to outlaw a beloved children’s TV show. A comedian going by the name Zayn Sheikh outraged many Brits (and fooled a number of news outlets, British and otherwise) with a YouTube video that demanded the TV show “Peppa Pig” go off air and suggested a national campaign would soon organize for that purpose. Peppa Pig is a beloved, alliterative British cartoon character — and also “haram,” or forbidden to Muslims, Sheikh claimed. Over the weekend, Sheikh posted a second video admitting the whole thing was a hoax — but a hoax for a cause. “This video served to show how much Islamophobia is around, for those who deny its existence,” he wrote. “It is sad to live in a society where some feel that Muslims have no rights to talk at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Obama will not “resign amid new Benghazi revelations.” Every word of this headline is a dream come true to some of the president’s more conspiracy-minded opponents, which perhaps explains why the fake article, from fake-article-generator National Report, went viral in those circles. As of this writing, it’s been shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. Even Donald Trump seems to have fallen for the “joke”!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Just kidding, that tweet is related to another matter entirely.)\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Cocaine has not been found in Coors Light beer. Since this is the second widespread cocaine-in-a-beverage hoax in as many weeks, let’s get a few things straight about the alleged phenomenon. First up: This hoax seems to do well because it has some remote, and long ago, bases in fact. (Cocaine-laced sodas and beverages were very popular in ye olden days, around the time of the Civil War.) It also helps that remote traces of coca have been found, at some point in time, in various popular beverages, including Red Bull. That said, no cocaine expose published on a site called Huzlers.com is ever going to be real. Ever. How have 286,000 people shared this stupid thing?\\r\\n\\r\\n10. The ruins of an ancient city were not discovered in the Australian desert. Perhaps the most incredible thing about this faux-story from World News Daily Report — besides the number of times people have reposted it to Facebook — is the amazingly credulous conversation readers are having in the comments section below it. “I thought the climate in central Australia had been arid for over 30,000 years,” one commenter wrote. “30,000 people living in the desert? That would require agriculture and irrigation … That’s just incredible!” Indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid we miss any other notable fake stuff this week?

       "241    (CNN) -- A meteorite crashed down in Managua, Nicaragua, late Saturday night, causing a loud explosion and leaving a crater 39 feet (12 meters) across, government officials said, according to The Associated Press. No damage or injuries were reported.\\r\\n\\r\\nAP quoted government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo as saying they've determined it was a \"relatively small\" meteorite that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNASA hasn't confirmed a link between the meteorite and the asteroid. The newly discovered asteroid, called 2014 RC, was expected to pass safely above the Earth on Sunday, NASA said, at a distance of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) -- just one-tenth the distance from the center of Earth to the moon. It was estimated to be 60 feet (18 meters) long.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal media reported that scientists are trying to find remains of the meteorite, and Nicaragua is asking the United States to help investigate the event.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite,\" Jose Millan with the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies was quoted as saying on the Today Nicaragua website.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut NASA's Bill Cooke is skeptical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been suggested that a meteorite may have caused this crater; however, the lack of fireball reports from the surrounding populated area seems to suggest some other cause,\" Cooke wrote in a NASA blog post.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The skies were partially clear, and an object capable of producing a crater this large would have also generated a very bright fireball (brighter than the Full Moon) that should have been seen over a wide area.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Today Nicaragua site reported the crater was found after a loud blast about 11:05 p.m. on Saturday. The Nicaragua Dispatch said the hole is in the woods near Managua's Sandino International Airport and about 1,000 feet (300 meters) from the Camino Real Hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nNASA's Near Earth Object Program estimates there are thousands of asteroids that could threaten Earth, but experts say none of the ones being tracked is expected to hit the planet anytime soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, though, space rocks sneak by the scientists and amateur astronomers who track them. On February 15, 2013, a nearly 60-foot-wide meteor plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 nuclear bombs. The blast injured about 1,500 people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chelyabinsk meteor was undetected before it was spotted by local residents as it streaked across the sky. It exploded on the same day that Asteroid 2012 DA14, one that was being carefully tracked by NASA, safely passed by Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nNASA is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten Earth. Its Asteroid Initiative includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s. If it works, astronauts will land on the asteroid, take samples and bring them back to Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN's Jeff Greene contributed to this report.

       "242    (CNN) -- A meteorite crashed down in Managua, Nicaragua, late Saturday night, causing a loud explosion and leaving a crater 39 feet (12 meters) across, government officials said, according to The Associated Press. No damage or injuries were reported.\\r\\n\\r\\nAP quoted government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo as saying they've determined it was a \"relatively small\" meteorite that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNASA hasn't confirmed a link between the meteorite and the asteroid. The newly discovered asteroid, called 2014 RC, was expected to pass safely above the Earth on Sunday, NASA said, at a distance of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) -- just one-tenth the distance from the center of Earth to the moon. It was estimated to be 60 feet (18 meters) long.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal media reported that scientists are trying to find remains of the meteorite, and Nicaragua is asking the United States to help investigate the event.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite,\" Jose Millan with the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies was quoted as saying on the Today Nicaragua website.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut NASA's Bill Cooke is skeptical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been suggested that a meteorite may have caused this crater; however, the lack of fireball reports from the surrounding populated area seems to suggest some other cause,\" Cooke wrote in a NASA blog post.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The skies were partially clear, and an object capable of producing a crater this large would have also generated a very bright fireball (brighter than the Full Moon) that should have been seen over a wide area.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Today Nicaragua site reported the crater was found after a loud blast about 11:05 p.m. on Saturday. The Nicaragua Dispatch said the hole is in the woods near Managua's Sandino International Airport and about 1,000 feet (300 meters) from the Camino Real Hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nNASA's Near Earth Object Program estimates there are thousands of asteroids that could threaten Earth, but experts say none of the ones being tracked is expected to hit the planet anytime soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, though, space rocks sneak by the scientists and amateur astronomers who track them. On February 15, 2013, a nearly 60-foot-wide meteor plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 nuclear bombs. The blast injured about 1,500 people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chelyabinsk meteor was undetected before it was spotted by local residents as it streaked across the sky. It exploded on the same day that Asteroid 2012 DA14, one that was being carefully tracked by NASA, safely passed by Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nNASA is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten Earth. Its Asteroid Initiative includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s. If it works, astronauts will land on the asteroid, take samples and bring them back to Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN's Jeff Greene contributed to this report.

       "402    Kai the shar pei-crossbreed was discovered tied to a railing outside Ayr railway station in Scotland with a case containing a pillow, toy, food and bowl\\r\\n\\r\\nA dog has been found abandoned at a railway station along with a suitcase filled with his belongings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scottish SPCA is keen to trace the owner of shar pei-crossbeed Kai, who was discovered tied to a railing outside Ayr station on Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was accompanied by a case containing items including a pillow, toy, food and bowl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dog was sold on the Gumtree website in 2013 and the charity is appealing for information to help trace whoever bought him.\\r\\n\\r\\nScottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said: \"The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.\\r\\n\\r\\nPA   Pooch passing through: Kai was found tied to a railing at Ayr station\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible. If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStation staff looked after Kai until the Scottish SPCA arrived at the scene on Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is now being cared for at the charity's centre in Glasgow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe charity said abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life.

       "410    An article saying NASA confirmed six days of “total darkness” in December is fake and it’s merely an iteration of an old Internet hoax.\\r\\n\\r\\nEssentially every year, there’s bogus rumors saying that there will be three days of darkness in December, but they’ve obviously proven not to be true.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey seem to reference the Three Days of Darkness mentioned by Catholic prophets.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a “satirical” and entertainment website, Huzlers.com, posted an article about six days of darkness. It uses fake quotes from a NASA official.\\r\\n\\r\\n“WORLDWIDE – NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 6 days of almost complete darkness and will happen from the dates Tuesday the 16 – Monday the 22 in December. The world will remain, during these three days, without sunlight due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight,” it reads in part.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Huzlers has a disclaimer that says it’s not real and shouldn’t ever be taken seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Huzlers.com is a combination of real shocking news and satirical entertainment to keep its visitors in a state of disbelier,” the About Us section reads on the bottom of each web page.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bogus NASA article had tens of thousands of shares and “likes” on Saturday.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Snopes.com, similar rumors have been going on for a while and have taken on different forms.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, the universe is not about to realign in December 2014, nor will there be a three-day blackout at that time during which the Earth will shift into a new dimension. Neither NASA nor any other credible scientific entity has made such a pronouncement. Ever,” the site says. “This item originated back in 2012, when interest in the belief that the Mayan calendar would end on 21 December 2012 (thus foretelling the end of the world as we know it) was running high, and it has simply been updated and recirculated with the year 2014 replacing the original references to 2012.”

       "500    DUBAI - A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen, describing them as anti-Islamic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country's north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: \"It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nQuoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,\" he wrote in his ruling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,\" one Twitter user wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a \"snow bride\" wearing a bra and lipstick. \"The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,\" he wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nA third said the country was plagued by two types of people:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,\" the user wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nSheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. \"It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,\" one wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognize matters that even Satan does not think about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow has covered upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia's border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle

       "505    Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured. Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story \"mere propaganda\". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible. Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting. Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north. Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet.

       "599    Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured. Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story \"mere propaganda\". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible. Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media.

       "614    Phoenix, AZ — A Phoenix boy is behind bars tonight after his mother called 9-1-1 when she found her son in his room, watching pornography and masturbating. Phoenix Police were quick to respond, arresting 15-year-old Paul Horner, who attends North Valley High School in Phoenix, Arizona. Now the teenager is being held without bail and charged by prosecutors under a new controversial Arizona state law called ‘Self-Rape’, which carries a minimum of 3 years in prison with a maximum of 15 years behind bars depending on that individuals past criminal history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the first time this new state law has been used since it was put into action last month by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. Brewer spoke with local news station ABC 15 about the charges against the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I applaud the Arizona District court systems here in Phoenix,” Brewer said. “This is exactly why I implemented the state law of ‘Self-Rape’ last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. Before my time as governor is up early next year, I’ll do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don’t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it’s too late.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHorner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the United States District Court in Phoenix, which included the brand new ‘Self-Rape’ state law, Horner immediately broke down into tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nTranscripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:\\r\\n\\r\\n“911, what’s your emergency?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Help! My son is watching porn and masturbating! That is not allowed in his house and I don’t know what kind of demons possessed him to degrade his body in such a matter. I’m so shakin’ up! Please send help immediately!”\\r\\n\\r\\n32-year-old Adeline Horner, Horner’s mother, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Up until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,” Horner’s mother said. “But somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil’s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWinters controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.\\r\\n\\r\\n“STOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Adeline Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,” Childs told reporters. “She really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Ant-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 36-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fappy® has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things. Our organization is passionate about the great work that we do. The children even have a nickname for Fappy®, they call him the tickle monster. Working side by side with such great women as Jan Brewer, we’re ridding the demons from these heathens pants, one pair of pants at a time. Fappy® vows to stay on this case until justice is served!”\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Downey with the Phoenix Police Department, who took the child into custody, spoke with Arizona news station Fox 10 News about the arrest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We thought at first he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about how we should leave him alone and just let him watch his filth, makes me sick! It’s a slippery slope my friend, one day it’s masturbating to porn, the next day it’s raping some innocent school girl. Thank God we got this heathen off the streets before another tragedy could have occurred.” Downey continued, “There’s no better feeling than putting the real bad guys behind bars. Nothing better than that. I know I can sleep better at night just knowing another criminal is off the streets.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficers confiscated the pornography and lube found in the teenagers room as evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nProsecutors told local reporters that based on the severity of the crime, the new Arizona state law of Self-Rape [A.R.S. §§ 29-169 & 48-69] would carry a minimum of 3 years with a maximum of 15 years depending on that criminals past history.\\r\\n\\r\\nHorner is currently being held at the Maricopa County Jail in Phoenix, Arizona. He presently has no bond set and the judge has restricted him from seeing visitors. Horner’s next scheduled court appearance is December 2nd.\\r\\n\\r\\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach both children and adults about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.

       "1199   The interwebs was all aflutter today with news that elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London’s Metropolitan Police. According to reports, after hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed. A video was even produced purporting to reveal Banksy’s real identity:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to reports:\\r\\n\\r\\n“…The City of London Police say Banksy’s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run. “We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky’s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,” Edwards said.”\\r\\n\\r\\n banksy-mugshot\\r\\n(ABOVE: A mugshot CLAIMING to have been taken by London Police today of Paul Horner AKA Banksy.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n“We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.” Edwards continued, “Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.”\\r\\n\\r\\npaul-horner-is-banksy\\r\\n(ABOVE: According to reports, this is a photo of Banksy, AKA Paul Horner, seen here being taken into police custody.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the “if it’s on the internet, it must be true” adage, we immediately smelled HOAX, so did a bit of digging (our mascot Fido is good at that).  It didn’t take long (30 seconds in fact), to rule this out as a not-very-elaborate fake.  We reached out to Banksy’s PR agent Jo Brooks, who confirmed the hoax in 3 simple words:\\r\\n\\r\\nBanksy’s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we can all breath a big sigh of relief… inhale, exhale… Banksy is still a mystery. Someone. Somewhere. Phew.

       "1252   FEARS have been raised that Islamic militants have seized a dozen commercial aircraft in an attack on a Libyan airport last week. Now, according to a report, intelligence agencies are warning the jets could be used in 9/11-style attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” one official told The Washington Free Beacon this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report said intelligence reports distributed within the US government over the past few weeks have detailed the types of aircraft believed seized. Several have the size and range to reach deep into Europe and Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beacon reports the analysts as issuing a specific warning — that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack on the date marking the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe threat warning comes as dramatic video reveals the final moments of a Libyan combat jet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aircraft plunged into the ground less than a kilometre from the country’s parliament during a fly-past intended to honour the pilot of another fighter jet that died in a crash a week ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resulting fireball damaged several nearby buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\nLibya is witnessing its worst violence since former dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi was toppled and killed in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country’s divisions are deeply rooted in rivalries between Islamists and non-Islamists, as well as powerful tribal and regional allegiances between groups that quickly filled the power vacuum after Gaddafi’s was ousted. Successive transitional governments have failed to control the militias.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIGHTING FLARES UP\\r\\n\\r\\nFierce clashes have erupted in recent days over Libya’s eastern city of Benghazi.\\r\\n\\r\\nFighting between Islamist militiamen and rival forces loyal to a renegade general killed 31 fighters on both sides, a security official said overnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting erupted late on Monday, with forces and fighter jets belonging to General Khalifa Hifter pounding positions of Islamist militias called The Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council, said the official.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue of foreign military intervention is one of the most debated in the country. Earlier this month, unknown parties carried out air strikes in Tripoli, bombing Islamist-allied militias’ positions. American officials confirmed reports that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were behind the two air strikes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hours-long clashes concentrated around the city’s Benina airport and the militiamen responded with artillery, added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media.\\r\\n\\r\\nHifter’s side lost 20 fighters while the militiamen had 11 killed, and 36 fighters in all were wounded, the official said. Several of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nFighting in recent months has mostly engulfed the capital, Tripoli, and also Benghazi, the country’s second-largest city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe militias in control of the capital, operating under an umbrella group called the Dawn of Libya, have also taken control of the US embassy compound a week after they drove out rival militias.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday, Libya’s official news agency said calm had returned to Tripoli, with some banks resuming work and shops and bakeries reopening. Traffic also picked up in the capital and there were long lines outside gas stations. Some families who fled the fighting areas have returned to their homes, the agency said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPOLITICAL CRISIS\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Monday, Libya’s newly elected parliament asked Abdullah al-Thinni — the country’s prime minister who resigned last week — to form a new government. Al-Thinni had said after his resignation that his government had lost control of almost all state institutions and government offices to the armed Islamist militias.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting forced the newly elected parliament and al-Thinni to operate in the eastern city of Tobruk.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday, Mohammed Shouaib, the deputy head of parliament, stressed that the body did not ask for “military intervention” but for the United Nations to help Libya build its institutions, including the police and military. He was referring to an earlier decision by the parliament to call for international help in restoring order in Libya.\\r\\n\\r\\nShouaib was speaking in a press conference with British envoy Jonathan Powell and British ambassador Michael Aron, who were visiting Tobruk to express support to the elected parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile in Tripoli, a parallel government is in the making. Supported by Islamist allies, the so-called National Salvation government led by Omar al-Hassi and his 14-ministers won a vote of confidence. Al-Hassi was appointed by the outgoing parliament — whose mandate expired after a new parliament was elected — and assigned him to form a new government to challenge the legitimate ones in Tobruk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "1377   McDonald’s Removing Big Mac, Apple Pies And Eliminating Large Size Options.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald’s has just announced that it will be phasing out 8 menu items the beginning of next year and most McDonald’s customers are not happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith McDonald’s profits tanking over the recent months, the company has had to make some tough decisions to find adequate solutions for their financial distress by shrinking menu sizes. “Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb,” spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. “To do so we must simplify our current menu.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald’s is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville.

       "1398   At least one of the big boys is planning on developing an app for the Apple Watch. eBay has posted an ad listing, looking for a developer to help them come up with a bidding app for Cupertino’s new smartwatch.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the ad was originally posted to eBay’s career page way back in November, it has only recently come to light through an ad posted to LinkedIn. The ad says that it is looking for a dev to join eBay’s New Technology Group, which operates out of Portland with over 200 engineers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the ad, the ideal candidate will “design and implement elegant solutions for the Apple Watch that will complement our core iOS eBay app.” That seems to indicate that whatever presence the eBay app has on the Apple Watch, it will tie into the core iPhone app.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat kind of functionality will the eBay Apple Watch app have? That’s up for speculation, although an alert app that lets you know when you’re about to be outbid, when your items have sold, and when a new watched search term pops up on the world’s largest internet auction site are all a good bet.

       "1691   It was a heartwarming story for legions of pet owners and animal lovers around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nPope Francis, talking to a distraught boy whose pet had died, declared there was a place in heaven for the creatures we share our lives with. His comment was reported this week by many news media outside Italy, with dozens of articles in the United States. It was veritable catnip to social media.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it turned out the pope had not made the comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nlRelated Pope Francis prays in Istanbul's Blue Mosque\\r\\nNATION & WORLD\\r\\nPope Francis prays in Istanbul's Blue Mosque\\r\\nSEE ALL RELATED\\t\\r\\n8\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov. 26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nPope Paul VI, who died in 1978, once said, reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died, \"one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done,\" the Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini, said on Saturday, when asked about how the media ran with the story.\\r\\n\\r\\ncComments\\r\\n@franniescarp In contrast to yours...\\r\\nJ. PAUL GETTY'S EAR\\r\\nAT 7:10 PM DECEMBER 13, 2014\\r\\nADD A COMMENTSEE ALL COMMENTS\\t\\r\\n6\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion News Service was among the first media to set the record straight. It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov. 27, whose headline was misleading.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe article recounted the pope's words from his general audience on Nov. 26, when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth. It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI, but its headline said \"The pope and animals. 'paradise is open to all creatures.'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York Times, which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis, acknowledged its mistake, saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked about the mistake, a spokeswoman for the Times quoted Michael Slackman, managing editor of international news, as saying, \"The correction in The Times notes that the specific content and wording were wrong in the article. However, the pope did in fact make comments suggesting heaven is open to animals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his Nov. 26 remarks, the pope referred to heaven saying \"the Sacred Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this marvelous plan cannot but affect all that which surrounds us and which emerged from the thought and the heart of God.\" He did not refer specifically to animals in his remarks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn its website, CNN also corrected its story, noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven. A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nReuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT DOES THE POPE THINK ABOUT PETS?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for what Francis does think about animals, he has not spoken much about them in public, but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures \"it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year, Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it. The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs, Benedettini said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God. In 2008, former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were \"called to eternity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nReuters

       "1721   After brutally beating up African youth at a metro station in New Delhi, the mob has now delivered brute justice, this time by castrating a man who was trying to rape a teenage girl in Ganganagar, Rajasthan\\r\\nThe mob dragged Suresh Kumar to a butcher's shop and castrated him with a meat cleaver\\r\\nThe accused Suresh Kumar\\r\\nThey then dumped his body parts and left him bleeding in the middle of the road. \\r\\nStripped Suresh Kumar awaits his punishment\\r\\nThe man has been admitted to a local hospital where his condition is described by doctors as critical. The girl he was trying to rape is in shock and has been sent for counselling. While anybody outraging the modesty of a girl must get the harshest punishment, it has to be within the confines of the law. This kind of street justice must only be condemned.

       "1725   After brutally beating up African youth at a metro station in New Delhi, the mob has now delivered brute justice, this time by castrating a man who was trying to rape a teenage girl in Ganganagar, Rajasthan\\r\\nThe mob dragged Suresh Kumar to a butcher's shop and castrated him with a meat cleaver\\r\\nThe accused Suresh Kumar\\r\\nThey then dumped his body parts and left him bleeding in the middle of the road. \\r\\nStripped Suresh Kumar awaits his punishment\\r\\nThe man has been admitted to a local hospital where his condition is described by doctors as critical. The girl he was trying to rape is in shock and has been sent for counselling. While anybody outraging the modesty of a girl must get the harshest punishment, it has to be within the confines of the law. This kind of street justice must only be condemned.

       "1780   After a full day spent lying on her back on a muddy wooden plank, chipping with painstaking care at the underside of a stone block to free the time capsule hidden within, Museum of Fine Arts conservator Pam Hatchfield sat up in front of the State House to a round of applause, a green box held delicately in her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I feel happy and relieved. And excited. And really interested to see what’s in this box,” she said Thursday night, after posing for a selfie with the capsule for her mom. The extrication took more than seven hours and involved about a dozen workers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original contents of the time capsule were first placed in 1795 by Governor Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and William Scollay in a ceremony that started in downtown Boston and proceeded to the State House, according to historical accounts. It was unearthed during emergency repairs to the foundation in 1855 and then buried again, and had not seen daylight until it emerged on Thursday.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building, but of our Commonwealth and our country,” said Secretary of State William Galvin, who was on hand for the capsule’s first appearance in more than 150 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe capsule is believed to include a collection of silver and copper coins dating from between 1652 and 1855; an engraved silver plate; newspapers; the seal of the Commonwealth; cards; and a title page from the Massachusetts Colony Records, according to Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter hours of work, Pam Hatchfield, a conservator at the Museum of Fine Arts, dislodged a time capsule from the cornerstone of the State House.\\r\\nARAM BOGHOSIAN FOR THE BOSTON GLOBE\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter hours of work, Pam Hatchfield, a conservator at the Museum of Fine Arts, dislodged a time capsule from the cornerstone of the State House.\\r\\n\\r\\n View Gallery\\r\\nPhotos: Capsule unearthed\\r\\nThe original contents of the time capsule were first placed in 1795 by Governor Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and William Scollay.\\r\\n Mass. time capsule contents include 350-year-old shilling\\r\\n\\r\\nHatchfield, who is head of Objects Conservation at the Museum of Fine Arts, said the corroded copper alloy box that holds the collection was undamaged by the removal process, and appeared to be in good shape. It was a little smaller than a cigar box and, she said, heavier than she expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe box was taken by State Police escort to the Museum of Fine Arts, where Hatchfield said it will be X-rayed to determine the contents. There was some concern, Galvin said, that there may be some damage to some of the coins, which may have been washed in acid before the box was reburied in 1855.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will be opened probably sometime next week,” said Galvin. The contents will be examined, he said, but the time capsule will not remain unburied. “Ultimately it will be put back in the box and ultimately back in the stone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGalvin said officials have not yet decided whether they will add any objects to the capsule before re-burying it. The capsule was discovered during the course of a water infiltration investigation at the State House, which identified the corner where it was hidden as an area of concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is believed to be one of the oldest time capsules in the state, according to Kelly. In October, a century-old time capsule was opened after it was removed from its perch in the head of a golden lion statue that had sat atop the Old State House in downtown Boston. Its contents included sealed letters, photographs, and newspaper articles in near-perfect condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Thursday, excavation of the State House time capsule began at about 9 a.m., with workers unwedging the stone block from the corner of the building and propping it up on blocks of wood so Hatchfield could slide underneath. The block was not flipped upside down, said Hatchfield, because she did not want to risk dislodging any of the contents.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom about 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Hatchfield tapped away at the block, taking periodic breaks to warm up away from the whipping wind and snow. Workers brought her a space heater. The plaster that sealed the box in, she said, was much harder than she anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she worked, tiny coins fell out of the plaster. During the 1855 reburial, public officials threw the coins in for good luck. Michael Comeau, executive director of the State Archives, said they appeared to be silver.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the day wore on, Hatchfield used a small circular saw and a drill to try to free the capsule, and several times, she appeared to think she was close, only to have the box remain stuck. It was the most physically challenging conservation job she has ever done, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have been privileged to spend all of my working life handling incredibly precious and important objects, and it is very exciting every single time,” said Hatchfield. “The sense of continuation of history that you get by entering a museum or historic site, but also by having it in your hands, is incredibly rewarding and enriching. And it gives meaning to a lot of people.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1798   EXTREMISTS fighting for the Islamic State (IS) have started launching bombs packed with live SCORPIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nBomb canisters – packed with the venemous arachnids – are being blasted into towns and villages to scatter scorpions and incite panic, a British military expert has revealed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer head of chemical and biological weapons for NATO and the British army Hamish de Bretton-Gordon described the arachnid attacks as \"madness\".\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told The Daily Mirror: \"It’s madness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"IS have improvised devices to launch them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They promote the fact that they are doing it and it creates panic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Scorpions are robust – even if they are launched a couple of miles, when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 24in scorpion bombs are not used for mass casualties but instead designed to maximise the terrorist group's \"psychological impact\" on the villagers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Bretton-Gordon, who returned from Baghdad last week where he had been advising security forces, added: \"The main thing is creating fear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSenior officials in Iraq have reported scorpions being used against civilian targets in northern parts of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 25 known species of scorpion with venom capable of killing a human being.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences to 'scorpion bombs' have been found dating back to 198 AD.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bizarre biological weapon was created when Iraqis began pouring scorpions into ceramic pots to hurl at the Roman armies storming the fortress city of Hatra.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scorpion-filled weapons have even been credited by some with ending the 20 day siege on the desert

       "49606  President Obama said Wednesday that the United States “will be vigilant and we will be relentless” against Islamic State militants and would “do what’s necessary to see that justice is done” following the videotaped execution of an American journalist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIL,” Obama said, using one of several acronyms for the group. The militants, who posted the video on YouTube Tuesday, said Foley’s killing was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama, who spoke Wednesday morning to Foley’s parents, offered no new policy measures to confront Islamic State. Referring to neighboring countries and U.S. allies, he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes, one U.S. official said the “only question is if we do more.” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama could face pressure to escalate the air campaign in Iraq and increase support to U.S.-backed rebels in Syria who are fighting against the Islamic Front, as well as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U.S. heavy weapons, including portable surface-to-air missiles, as well as for American air support.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement issued after the president’s remarks, Rep.

       "49648  Oh Internet, when will you ever stop killing perfectly healthy celebrities, or at least those that are healthy enough to be alive? Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEnough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRELATED: Since we’re talking about GNR, do yourself a favor and go back and read Danger Guerrero’s breakdown of “November Rain.”

       "49660  Oh Internet, when will you ever stop killing perfectly healthy celebrities, or at least those that are healthy enough to be alive? Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEnough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRELATED: Since we’re talking about GNR, do yourself a favor and go back and read Danger Guerrero’s breakdown of “November Rain.”

       "49665  Oh Internet, when will you ever stop killing perfectly healthy celebrities, or at least those that are healthy enough to be alive? Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEnough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRELATED: Since we’re talking about GNR, do yourself a favor and go back and read Danger Guerrero’s breakdown of “November Rain.”

       "49679  Oh Internet, when will you ever stop killing perfectly healthy celebrities, or at least those that are healthy enough to be alive? Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEnough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRELATED: Since we’re talking about GNR, do yourself a favor and go back and read Danger Guerrero’s breakdown of “November Rain.”

       "49690  Oh Internet, when will you ever stop killing perfectly healthy celebrities, or at least those that are healthy enough to be alive? Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEnough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRELATED: Since we’re talking about GNR, do yourself a favor and go back and read Danger Guerrero’s breakdown of “November Rain.”

       "49699  Oh Internet, when will you ever stop killing perfectly healthy celebrities, or at least those that are healthy enough to be alive? Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEnough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRELATED: Since we’re talking about GNR, do yourself a favor and go back and read Danger Guerrero’s breakdown of “November Rain.”

       "49701  Oh Internet, when will you ever stop killing perfectly healthy celebrities, or at least those that are healthy enough to be alive? Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEnough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRELATED: Since we’re talking about GNR, do yourself a favor and go back and read Danger Guerrero’s breakdown of “November Rain.”

Each 5-foot tall, 300-pound K5 is equipped with arrays of high-definition camera, sensors, debilitating sirens, Wi-Fi and artificial intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe squat policing robots are the product of Knightscope, a startup firm from Mountain View, Calif. William Santana Li, chairman and CEO of Knightscope, sees a world in which his company's policing robots move out of the private sector and start working alongside law enforcement officers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Technology and robotics are making the concept of Precision Policing -- a systematic, proactive and almost precognitive approach to ensuring public safety -- a real possibility,\" said Li in a March blog post.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5s can use their sensors to track down threats and their Wi-Fi connection to call in bipedal backup, aka security guards. Their AI and camera rigs enable the K5s to do a good deal of profiling, scanning license plates and faces to compare against databases available to them over Wi-Fi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5 robots are only tools to surveil, assess and report suspicious activity, for now at least. There are plans in the works that could see the K5s brandishing and using Taser guns -- \"you are being neutralized.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5s sensors enable them to recognize and analyze alphanumeric text, heat signatures, sounds, air quality and infrared light. The robots are equipped with both radar and Lidar to help them make measurements, while GPS helps them maintain their bearing and report their positions. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, is a remote-sensing technology used to measure distance by illuminating a target with a laser and then analyzing the reflected light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe robots are fully autonomous and can even refuel at a charging station without the guidance of humans. The K5s leverage their machine learning abilities for predictive analytics, analyzing and accounting for risks in real time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo keep people assured that the machines aren't abusing their abilities or beginning to learn too much, Knightscope plans to let people keep an eye on the machines by making the K5s' video feeds available to the public online.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe robots are the perfect tools to handle the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work in order to free up humans to more judiciously address activities requiring higher-level thinking, hands-on encounters, or

       "49860  While Daleks \"know no fear\" and \"must not fear,\" the cold, calculating robots from the Dr. Who series don't exist in the real world yet and Microsoft has had to settle on the next best thing for securing its campuses: the K5.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft is the first company in Silicon Valley to dispatch a fleet of the K5 policing robots. Each 5-foot tall, 300-pound K5 is equipped with arrays of high-definition camera, sensors, debilitating sirens, Wi-Fi and artificial intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe squat policing robots are the product of Knightscope, a startup firm from Mountain View, Calif. William Santana Li, chairman and CEO of Knightscope, sees a world in which his company's policing robots move out of the private sector and start working alongside law enforcement officers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Technology and robotics are making the concept of Precision Policing -- a systematic, proactive and almost precognitive approach to ensuring public safety -- a real possibility,\" said Li in a March blog post.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5s can use their sensors to track down threats and their Wi-Fi connection to call in bipedal backup, aka security guards. Their AI and camera rigs enable the K5s to do a good deal of profiling, scanning license plates and faces to compare against databases available to them over Wi-Fi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5 robots are only tools to surveil, assess and report suspicious activity, for now at least. There are plans in the works that could see the K5s brandishing and using Taser guns -- \"you are being neutralized.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5s sensors enable them to recognize and analyze alphanumeric text, heat signatures, sounds, air quality and infrared light. The robots are equipped with both radar and Lidar to help them make measurements, while GPS helps them maintain their bearing and report their positions. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, is a remote-sensing technology used to measure distance by illuminating a target with a laser and then analyzing the reflected light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe robots are fully autonomous and can even refuel at a charging station without the guidance of humans. The K5s leverage their machine learning abilities for predictive analytics, analyzing and accounting for risks in real time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo keep people assured that the machines aren't abusing their abilities or beginning to learn too much, Knightscope plans to let people keep an eye on the machines by making the K5s' video feeds available to the public online.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe robots are the perfect tools to handle the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work in order to free up humans to more judiciously address activities requiring higher-level thinking, hands-on encounters, or

       "49861  While Daleks \"know no fear\" and \"must not fear,\" the cold, calculating robots from the Dr. Who series don't exist in the real world yet and Microsoft has had to settle on the next best thing for securing its campuses: the K5.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft is the first company in Silicon Valley to dispatch a fleet of the K5 policing robots. Each 5-foot tall, 300-pound K5 is equipped with arrays of high-definition camera, sensors, debilitating sirens, Wi-Fi and artificial intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe squat policing robots are the product of Knightscope, a startup firm from Mountain View, Calif. William Santana Li, chairman and CEO of Knightscope, sees a world in which his company's policing robots move out of the private sector and start working alongside law enforcement officers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Technology and robotics are making the concept of Precision Policing -- a systematic, proactive and almost precognitive approach to ensuring public safety -- a real possibility,\" said Li in a March blog post.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5s can use their sensors to track down threats and their Wi-Fi connection to call in bipedal backup, aka security guards. Their AI and camera rigs enable the K5s to do a good deal of profiling, scanning license plates and faces to compare against databases available to them over Wi-Fi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5 robots are only tools to surveil, assess and report suspicious activity, for now at least. There are plans in the works that could see the K5s brandishing and using Taser guns -- \"you are being neutralized.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5s sensors enable them to recognize and analyze alphanumeric text, heat signatures, sounds, air quality and infrared light. The robots are equipped with both radar and Lidar to help them make measurements, while GPS helps them maintain their bearing and report their positions. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, is a remote-sensing technology used to measure distance by illuminating a target with a laser and then analyzing the reflected light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe robots are fully autonomous and can even refuel at a charging station without the guidance of humans. The K5s leverage their machine learning abilities for predictive analytics, analyzing and accounting for risks in real time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo keep people assured that the machines aren't abusing their abilities or beginning to learn too much, Knightscope plans to let people keep an eye on the machines by making the K5s' video feeds available to the public online.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe robots are the perfect tools to handle the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work in order to free up humans to more judiciously address activities requiring higher-level thinking, hands-on encounters, or

       "49862  While Daleks \"know no fear\" and \"must not fear,\" the cold, calculating robots from the Dr. Who series don't exist in the real world yet and Microsoft has had to settle on the next best thing for securing its campuses: the K5.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft is the first company in Silicon Valley to dispatch a fleet of the K5 policing robots. Each 5-foot tall, 300-pound K5 is equipped with arrays of high-definition camera, sensors, debilitating sirens, Wi-Fi and artificial intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe squat policing robots are the product of Knightscope, a startup firm from Mountain View, Calif. William Santana Li, chairman and CEO of Knightscope, sees a world in which his company's policing robots move out of the private sector and start working alongside law enforcement officers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Technology and robotics are making the concept of Precision Policing -- a systematic, proactive and almost precognitive approach to ensuring public safety -- a real possibility,\" said Li in a March blog post.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5s can use their sensors to track down threats and their Wi-Fi connection to call in bipedal backup, aka security guards. Their AI and camera rigs enable the K5s to do a good deal of profiling, scanning license plates and faces to compare against databases available to them over Wi-Fi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5 robots are only tools to surveil, assess and report suspicious activity, for now at least. There are plans in the works that could see the K5s brandishing and using Taser guns -- \"you are being neutralized.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5s sensors enable them to recognize and analyze alphanumeric text, heat signatures, sounds, air quality and infrared light. The robots are equipped with both radar and Lidar to help them make measurements, while GPS helps them maintain their bearing and report their positions. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, is a remote-sensing technology used to measure distance by illuminating a target with a laser and then analyzing the reflected light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe robots are fully autonomous and can even refuel at a charging station without the guidance of humans. The K5s leverage their machine learning abilities for predictive analytics, analyzing and accounting for risks in real time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo keep people assured that the machines aren't abusing their abilities or beginning to learn too much, Knightscope plans to let people keep an eye on the machines by making the K5s' video feeds available to the public online.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe robots are the perfect tools to handle the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work in order to free up humans to more judiciously address activities requiring higher-level thinking, hands-on encounters, or

       "49863  While Daleks \"know no fear\" and \"must not fear,\" the cold, calculating robots from the Dr. Who series don't exist in the real world yet and Microsoft has had to settle on the next best thing for securing its campuses: the K5.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft is the first company in Silicon Valley to dispatch a fleet of the K5 policing robots. Each 5-foot tall, 300-pound K5 is equipped with arrays of high-definition camera, sensors, debilitating sirens, Wi-Fi and artificial intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe squat policing robots are the product of Knightscope, a startup firm from Mountain View, Calif. William Santana Li, chairman and CEO of Knightscope, sees a world in which his company's policing robots move out of the private sector and start working alongside law enforcement officers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Technology and robotics are making the concept of Precision Policing -- a systematic, proactive and almost precognitive approach to ensuring public safety -- a real possibility,\" said Li in a March blog post.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5s can use their sensors to track down threats and their Wi-Fi connection to call in bipedal backup, aka security guards. Their AI and camera rigs enable the K5s to do a good deal of profiling, scanning license plates and faces to compare against databases available to them over Wi-Fi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5 robots are only tools to surveil, assess and report suspicious activity, for now at least. There are plans in the works that could see the K5s brandishing and using Taser guns -- \"you are being neutralized.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K5s sensors enable them to recognize and analyze alphanumeric text, heat signatures, sounds, air quality and infrared light. The robots are equipped with both radar and Lidar to help them make measurements, while GPS helps them maintain their bearing and report their positions. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, is a remote-sensing technology used to measure distance by illuminating a target with a laser and then analyzing the reflected light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe robots are fully autonomous and can even refuel at a charging station without the guidance of humans. The K5s leverage their machine learning abilities for predictive analytics, analyzing and accounting for risks in real time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo keep people assured that the machines aren't abusing their abilities or beginning to learn too much, Knightscope plans to let people keep an eye on the machines by making the K5s' video feeds available to the public online.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe robots are the perfect tools to handle the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work in order to free up humans to more judiciously address activities requiring higher-level thinking, hands-on encounters, or
